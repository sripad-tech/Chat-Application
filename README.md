First RUN the server.cpp file, so that the server is up and running.
Then Run Client1.cpp , Enter your chat name 
Then Run Client2.cpp, Enter your chat name

Once you see Clients connected in your server, you can start messaging from 1 client to another.
This can be extended to multiple clients aswell.

Hurrah !! you have successfully build your own Chat Application using Socket Programming library WinSock2 in C++.
